Codebook for tidy data created by run_analysis.R
======================================================================================

#### Summary

This codebook file provides the list of variables in the tidy data set generated by "run_analysis.R". Each row of the tidy data corresponds to average values of measurements for a particular subject and a particular activity. 

All variables have a prefix "avg" to denote that these are average values. "Acc" in the variable name indicates acceleration data. "Gyro" in the variable name refers to angular velocity.

Two examples are explained here. Consider "avgTimeBodyAccMeanX". "Time" in the variable name indicates that the underlying data used for computing this variable is a time series. The part "BodyAcc" refers to the component, in this case body component of acceleration. "X" represents the axis or direction of measurement. "Mean" indicates that the mean value of the time series was stored in the raw data file. So this variable should be interpreted as the "Average of means of body component of acceleration in time series along X direction"

Another example is "avgFreqBodyGyroStdY"."Freq" indicates that the Fourier Transform (of the time series) is the underlying data that was used for computing this variable."BodyGyro" refers to body component of angular velocity."X" represents the axis of measurement."Std" denotes that the standard deviation value was stored in the raw data file. Therefore, this variable can be interpreted as the "Average of standard deviations of the body component of angular velocity in fourier transform (of time series) along  Y direction".
 
#### Study Design

The raw data for this analysis came from the "UCI HAR Dataset". A brief summary of the data collection is provided here. For more details, refer to the "README.txt" file of the "UCI HAR Dataset" that can be downloaded from "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip". The reference for the 
data set is given below:

Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012

The training and test data from that data set were used for the creation of the tidy data. The experiments were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers. Each person performed six activities wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Data was captured using using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments were video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

Details of how "run_analysis" code processes this raw data to create the tidy data set can be found in the "README.md" accompanying "run_analysis.R"
